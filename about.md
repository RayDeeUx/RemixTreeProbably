# RemixTreeProbably

Shows a list of levels that are clones/remixes of a level of your choice. Find the button in the comments section of a level.

Because for some reason, people are too lazy to open their web browser to type in  `https://history.geometrydash.eu/search/?original=`  followed by the level ID of their choice.

Thanks to Cvolton for their GDHistory API.

<c-ffff00>***__API requests to GDHistory are hard-capped at 100 levels.__*** *If you want to see more levels (eat my shorts), please read the second paragraph again for a really crucial hint.*</c>

## <c-ff0000>Results shown by this mod are ***__FOR REFERENCE ONLY__***.</c>

<c-ff0000>***__Using this mod should not be a justification/excuse to harass other level creators (or the developers who made this mod possible) for whatever reason you see fit as a result of viewing the search results.__***</c>

Mod idea suggested by [SquareGD/The Bacon Army](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLh0ctfFz61WayJhcXjjf1A). Mod name inspired by [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)'s "Remix Tree" feature.
