# RemixTreeProbably

Shows a list of levels that are clones/remixes of a level of your choice. Find the button in the comments section of a level.

Because for some reason, people are too lazy to open their web browser to type in `https://history.geometrydash.eu/search/?original=` followed by the level ID of their choice.

Thanks to Cvolton for their GDHistory API.

API requests to GDHistory are hard-capped at 100 levels. If you want to see more levels (eat my shorts), please read the second paragraph again for a really crucial hint.

Mod idea suggested by [SquareGD/The Bacon Army](https://youtube.com/@squaregd). Mod name inspired by [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)'s "Remix Tree" feature.
